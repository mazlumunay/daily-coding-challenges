## Phase 4: Interview Ready (Weeks 11-12)

### Week 11: Timed Sessions
- Set a **25-minute timer** per problem
- Re-solve problems you struggled with from Weeks 1-10
- Practice explaining your approach **out loud**
- Focus on your 3 weakest patterns

### Week 12: Mock Interview Mode
- Pick **2 random medium problems** daily
- Solve on paper first, then code
- Record yourself explaining time/space complexity
- Do at least 2 full mock interviews (use [Pramp](https://www.pramp.com/) — it's free)

---

## 🧠 For Every Single Problem, Do This:

1. **Read the problem** — understand inputs, outputs, constraints
2. **Think for 5-10 minutes** — write pseudo-code on paper
3. **Write brute force first** — get it working, don't optimize yet
4. **Optimize** — can you reduce time? space? better data structure?
5. **State complexity out loud** — "This is O(n) time, O(1) space because..."
6. **Test with edge cases** — empty input, single element, duplicates
7. **Commit and push** — clear commit message with complexity noted
8. **If stuck for 30+ minutes** — watch NeetCode's video, then re-solve from scratch
