- Re-solve problems you struggled with
- Practice explaining your approach out loud

### Week 12: Mock Interview Mode
- Pick 2 random medium problems daily
- Solve on whiteboard/paper first, then code
- Record yourself explaining time/space complexity
- Review your weakest pattern one more time

## 📋 Pattern Priority (Learn in This Order)

1. **Arrays & Hashing** — Foundation of everything
2. **Two Pointers** — Sorted arrays, palindromes
3. **Sliding Window** — Substrings, subarrays
4. **Stack** — Parentheses, monotonic stack
5. **Binary Search** — Sorted data, search space reduction
6. **Linked List** — Pointer manipulation
7. **Trees** — Recursion, DFS, BFS
8. **Graphs** — DFS, BFS, topological sort
9. **Dynamic Programming** — Optimization, counting
10. **Greedy** — Local optimal = global optimal
11. **Backtracking** — Combinations, permutations
12. **Heap / Priority Queue** — Top K, scheduling

## 🧠 For Every Single Problem, Do This:

1. **Read the problem** — understand inputs, outputs, constraints
2. **Think for 5-10 minutes** — write pseudo-code on paper
3. **Write brute force first** — get it working, don't optimize yet
4. **Optimize** — can you reduce time? space? use a better data structure?
5. **State complexity out loud** — "This is O(n) time, O(1) space because..."
6. **Test with edge cases** — empty input, single element, duplicates
7. **Commit and push** — clear commit message with complexity noted
8. **If stuck for 30+ minutes** — watch NeetCode's video explanation, then re-solve from scratch
